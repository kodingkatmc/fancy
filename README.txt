Project: Fancy Text

Info:
This project prints the contents of g_raw.txt to main.html. The text is displayed in a typerwriter-esq format, where each letter is added to the screen one at a time. Additionally, a typing sound is played while this happens. Finally each line of text in g_raw.txt is treated as a seperate page in the output html document.
