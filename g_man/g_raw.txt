Dear [retracted], (click again)
It is amazing that our four years in [retracted] have passed. While we didn't know each other that well in the beginning, spending time and getting to know you these last couple of years has been great. I believe the first thing I heared about you was your writing style, cursive. From there I only heared good things about you.
While you admire my accomplishments, yours are even greater. You can not simply replicate the friends and connections you made. People trust you. You're seen as neutral. These qualities you have are built up over time. I admire the loyalty you show.
I not usually sentimental but reading your letter last night, I felt something that I haven't felt in a while. Not sad, not happy; nostalagic I guess. Thankyou for brining back some of the memories from [retracted].
You will do great in your future. I hope [retracted] treats you well, and I hope we stay connected there; maybe we can through a football around sometime.
Well, adios amigos. I hope you are not blinded by the lights of the future.
Sincerely, Your Friend [retracted]
